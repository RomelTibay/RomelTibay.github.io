How you accomplished each item in the criteria except for README file discussion

- I took a few steps to create the website. First, I added a video in the background that adjusts when viewed on different devices. I made sure the colors and style were appealing, using black and white with a hint of orange for a nice look. I used a special font called Poppins to make the text appear modern and clean. The top navigation bar has evenly spaced links, and I've added a hamburger menu for small screens to make it easier to navigate. Each section of the website, such as the profile and about pages, was designed to be visually appealing and well-organized. The scrolling was made smooth for a better user experience. In the profile section, I added a cool effect that fades everything in slowly, including the title and other elements. Buttons and icons were designed to look good and function properly. The background video also has a blurry effect to add interest. Overall, I tried to keep things simple and create a website that looked good and worked well.

Insights that you have gathered while accomplishing LT0, LT1, and M1M2 (Guided Exercise 1)

- From the exercise, I learned that GitHub is really handy for keeping track of changes in my coding projects. I think it's something I'll use a lot in the future. I also found that working with HTML and CSS is easier for me compared to backend languages. Front-end coding, like HTML and CSS, feels simpler and more user-friendly. I enjoy it because I can be creative without feeling stressed, unlike when I work with backend languages, which can be more complicated. This exercise helped me understand these things better and showed me what I like about coding.

Struggles that you have encountered while accomplishing LT0, LT1, and M1M2 (Guided Exercise 1)

- The main challenge I faced during the exercise was remembering all the different things I needed to do in HTML and CSS. It felt a bit overwhelming, but the links provided in the exercise were really helpful. I think I might be a slow learner, but going through the tasks actually helped me get a better understanding of how HTML and CSS work. Even though it was a bit tough, I'm glad I learned something from it.

How you could improve your website in the future

- I believe I can make my website better by being more creative with the design. Adding more animations could make it more interesting for visitors. It would also be helpful to showcase more projects on my site, making it easier for potential employers to see my skills. I feel like I can work more on choosing colors that go well together. Overall, I did my best with what I know and tried to be creative by adding different ideas to design my website.

Other thoughts that might be noteworthy

- I believe I should practice more and try to be more creative in my thinking. Building confidence in both my coding and creative skills is important so that I can share my work with people who might be interested in what I can do. It's a process of learning and growing.
